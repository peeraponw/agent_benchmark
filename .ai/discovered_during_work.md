## Remaining Unprocessed Items

### Newly Discovered During Phase 1.1 Completion (2024-12-19)

4. **MCP Server Implementation Enhancement**
   - The basic MCP server created needs actual tool implementations
   - Web search tool integration with real APIs
   - Vector search integration with Qdrant
   - File access security and sandboxing

5. **Validation Script Dependency Management**
   - Created scripts/requirements.txt for PyYAML dependency
   - Consider adding validation script to main project dependencies
   - Add automated installation of validation dependencies

6. **Environment Template Security**
   - Add guidance for secure secret generation
   - Include instructions for API key management
   - Add validation for secret strength

### Completed During UV Modernization (2024-12-19)

7. **UV Package Management Migration** ✅
   - Replaced requirements.txt with pyproject.toml for MCP server
   - Updated Dockerfile to use UV's modern dependency management
   - Implemented UV sync and caching for better build performance
   - Added proper dependency groups (dev dependencies)
   - Configured UV-specific settings (package = false for service)

8. **Project Cleanup** ✅
   - Removed CONTRIBUTING.md and LICENSE files as requested
   - Updated README.md to remove references to deleted files
   - Modernized development standards section
   - Updated validation script to check for pyproject.toml instead of requirements.txt

### Completed During Environment Isolation & LLM Standardization (2024-12-19)

9. **Scripts Environment Isolation** ✅
   - Created dedicated `scripts/pyproject.toml` with UV package management
   - Added PyYAML, Pydantic, and Rich dependencies for enhanced validation
   - Implemented isolated UV environment for scripts execution
   - Enhanced validation script with Rich formatting for better output
   - Updated script execution to use `uv run` instead of direct Python calls

10. **LLM Provider Standardization** ✅
    - Removed all direct LLM provider configurations (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure)
    - Standardized all frameworks to use OpenRouter as single LLM provider
    - Updated all `.env.template` files across 5 frameworks:
      - Replaced multiple API keys with single `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
      - Added `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` configuration
      - Updated default models to use OpenRouter endpoints
    - Configured framework-specific model defaults:
      - CrewAI: `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet-20241022` (Claude Sonnet 4)
      - DSPy: `google/gemini-2.5-pro` (Google Gemini 2.5 Pro)
      - PocketFlow: `deepseek/deepseek-r1` (DeepSeek R1)
      - Google ADK: `google/gemini-2.5-pro` (Google Gemini 2.5 Pro)
      - Pydantic AI: `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet-20241022` (Claude Sonnet 4)
    - Updated documentation (GETTING_STARTED.md, ARCHITECTURE.md) to reflect OpenRouter usage
    - Updated validation script to check for OpenRouter configuration
    - Removed Google Cloud credentials requirements from Google ADK template

### Completed During Model Standardization (2024-12-19)

11. **DeepSeek R1 Default Model Standardization** ✅
    - Standardized all 5 frameworks to use `deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528` as default model
    - Updated model identifiers to use correct OpenRouter endpoints:
      - `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4` (Claude Sonnet 4)
      - `google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview` (Google Gemini 2.5 Pro)
      - `deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528` (DeepSeek R1) [DEFAULT]
    - Enhanced environment templates with model switching guidance
    - Added example configurations for easy model comparison studies
    - Updated GETTING_STARTED.md to reflect DeepSeek R1 as default
    - Created comprehensive MODEL_COMPARISON_GUIDE.md for systematic testing
    - Maintained flexibility for framework-specific model optimization
    - All validation checks continue to pass (77/77 success rate)

### Future Considerations (Not yet assigned to specific tasks)

1. **Advanced Performance Monitoring**
   - Integration with external monitoring services (DataDog, New Relic)
   - Advanced security scanning and compliance checking
   - Multi-language documentation support

2. **Enterprise Features**
   - Integration with package managers and distribution platforms
   - Enterprise deployment templates and guides
   - Advanced authentication and authorization systems

3. **Community Growth Features**
   - Plugin architecture for custom frameworks
   - Framework contribution templates and guidelines
   - Community showcase and case studies section

## Notes

- **Processing Status**: All actionable items from Phase 1.1 discoveries have been moved to formal task files
- **Remaining Items**: Only future considerations that don't yet warrant formal task creation
- **Next Review**: These remaining items should be re-evaluated during Phase 2 planning or when project scope expands to include enterprise/community features
