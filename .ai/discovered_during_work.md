# Discovered Tasks During Phase 1.1 Implementation

**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Phase**: 1.1 - Repository Initialization and Global Structure  

## Tasks Discovered During Implementation

### High Priority (Should be moved to Task 002)

1. **Create shared infrastructure Docker templates**
   - Need to create `shared_infrastructure/docker-compose.template.yaml`
   - Need to create environment variable templates for each framework
   - Need to create port allocation documentation

2. **Enhance validation script capabilities**
   - Add validation for file content quality (not just existence)
   - Add validation for JSON file structure
   - Add validation for Docker template syntax

3. **Create framework-specific .env templates**
   - Each framework directory needs `.env.template` files
   - Need to document API key requirements
   - Need to establish port allocation strategy

### Medium Priority (Future phases)

4. **Add contributing guidelines**
   - Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` with development workflow
   - Add code style guidelines
   - Add testing requirements

5. **Create license file**
   - Add appropriate open source license
   - Update README.md references to license

6. **Enhance dataset placeholder content**
   - Expand Q&A dataset to 20+ questions
   - Add more diverse document types for RAG testing
   - Create more complex multi-agent scenarios

### Low Priority (Nice to have)

7. **Add project badges to README**
   - Build status badges
   - Coverage badges
   - Version badges

8. **Create project logo and branding**
   - Design project logo
   - Create consistent visual identity

9. **Add automated structure validation in CI/CD**
   - Integrate validation script into GitHub Actions
   - Add automated testing for structure integrity

## Implementation Notes

- All Phase 1.1 tasks completed successfully with 100% validation pass rate
- Project structure follows the specification exactly
- Documentation is comprehensive and ready for development teams
- Validation script provides good foundation for ongoing structure integrity checks

## Recommendations for Next Phase

1. Prioritize shared infrastructure templates (items 1-3 above)
2. Begin Phase 1.2 with focus on shared global components
3. Consider creating framework-specific setup scripts for easier onboarding
