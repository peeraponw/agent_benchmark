- [ ] Code maintainability significantly improved

## Implementation Notes
- Maintain backward compatibility throughout all refactoring
- Use incremental refactoring approach to minimize risk
- Test each module independently after splitting
- Ensure all imports work correctly after reorganization
- Follow established coding patterns and conventions
- Document all new error types and handling patterns
- Use consistent error message formatting
- Implement comprehensive logging for debugging
- Consider performance impact of new validation features
- Design migration system to be extensible for future needs

## Dependencies and Integration
- Must not break existing Task 002 (Evaluation Framework) functionality
- Must not break existing Task 003 (Dataset Manager) functionality
- Should prepare codebase for Phase 2 framework implementations
- Consider impact on future framework-specific configurations
- Ensure compatibility with external MCP server integrations

## Next Steps
After completion, the codebase will be ready for Phase 2 framework implementation with:
- Clean, maintainable code organization
- Robust error handling and validation
- Comprehensive documentation
- Performance monitoring capabilities
- Future-proof migration system

This sets the foundation for implementing DSPy, PocketFlow, CrewAI, Google ADK, and Pydantic AI frameworks with confidence in the underlying infrastructure.
