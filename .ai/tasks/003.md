- Follow consistent error handling patterns throughout
- Ensure all file operations are atomic where possible
- **Focus on creating datasets that can effectively differentiate framework capabilities**
- **Ensure datasets are challenging enough to reveal framework limitations**
- **Maintain consistency with evaluation framework metrics and scoring**
- **Consider real-world use cases and practical applications**

## Dependencies and Integration
