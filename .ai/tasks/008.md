- [ ] Security documentation is comprehensive and actionable
- [ ] Automated security checks are integrated into development workflow
- [ ] External secret management integration is documented
- [ ] Security test suite validates all security controls

## Implementation Notes
- Use industry-standard cryptographic libraries for secret generation
- Follow OWASP guidelines for secret management
- Implement defense-in-depth security principles
- Make security tools easy to use to encourage adoption
- Provide clear error messages and remediation guidance
- Ensure all security tools work across different operating systems

## Security Standards
- Secrets must have minimum 32 characters with high entropy
- API keys must follow provider-specific format validation
- All sensitive data must be properly marked and handled
- Default configurations must be secure by default
- Security documentation must be kept up-to-date

## Integration Points
- Integrate with existing validation script infrastructure
- Work with UV package management for security tool dependencies
- Coordinate with external MCP server security implementations
- Align with Docker security best practices
- Support local development security workflows

## Next Steps
After completion, the project will have:
- Comprehensive security guidance for all deployments
- Automated tools for secure configuration management
- Integration-ready secret management capabilities
- Security-validated environment templates across all frameworks
