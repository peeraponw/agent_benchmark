# Project Management Methodologies and Best Practices

## Introduction
Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements. Effective project management ensures projects are completed on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards.

## Project Management Methodologies

### Waterfall
Sequential approach with distinct phases:
1. Requirements gathering
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

**Pros**: Clear structure, well-documented, predictable
**Cons**: Inflexible, late testing, assumes stable requirements

### Agile
Iterative approach emphasizing collaboration and adaptability:
- Short iterations (sprints)
- Regular customer feedback
- Adaptive planning
- Cross-functional teams

**Frameworks**: Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP)

### Scrum
Agile framework with specific roles and ceremonies:
- **Roles**: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team
- **Events**: Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Sprint Review, Retrospective
- **Artifacts**: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment

### Kanban
Visual workflow management:
- Kanban board with columns (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Work-in-progress (WIP) limits
- Continuous flow
- Pull-based system
