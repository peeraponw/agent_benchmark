Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms build mathematical models based on training data to make predictions or decisions.

Key Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning: Uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. Examples include classification and regression tasks.

2. Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns in data without labeled examples. Common techniques include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

3. Reinforcement Learning: Learns through interaction with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties for actions taken.

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to model and understand complex patterns in data. It has been particularly successful in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

Applications of AI and ML span numerous industries including healthcare, finance, transportation, entertainment, and manufacturing. As these technologies continue to advance, they are reshaping how we work, communicate, and solve complex problems.
