# Blockchain Technology and Applications

## Introduction
Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography.

## Core Concepts

### Distributed Ledger
- Decentralized database
- No single point of failure
- Consensus mechanisms
- Immutable records

### Cryptographic Hashing
- SHA-256 algorithm
- Unique digital fingerprints
- Tamper detection
- Chain integrity

### Consensus Mechanisms
- Proof of Work (PoW)
- Proof of Stake (PoS)
- Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
- Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance

## Applications

### Cryptocurrencies
- Bitcoin: First blockchain application
- Ethereum: Smart contract platform
- Stablecoins: Price-stable cryptocurrencies
- Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)

### Smart Contracts
- Self-executing contracts
- Automated enforcement
- Reduced intermediaries
- Programmable money

### Supply Chain Management
- Product traceability
- Authenticity verification
- Compliance monitoring
- Transparency

### Digital Identity
- Self-sovereign identity
- Credential verification
- Privacy protection
- Reduced identity theft

## Benefits and Challenges

### Benefits
- Transparency and trust
