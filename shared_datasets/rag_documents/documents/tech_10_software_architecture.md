# Software Architecture Patterns and Design Principles

## Introduction
Software architecture defines the high-level structure of a software system, including components, their relationships, and the principles governing their design and evolution.

## Architectural Patterns

### Layered Architecture
Organizes system into horizontal layers:
- **Presentation Layer**: User interface
- **Business Layer**: Business logic and rules
- **Persistence Layer**: Data access
- **Database Layer**: Data storage

**Pros**: Clear separation of concerns, easy to understand
**Cons**: Performance overhead, tight coupling between layers

### Microservices Architecture
Decomposes application into small, independent services:
- Each service owns its data
- Services communicate via APIs
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Technology diversity

**Pros**: Scalability, technology flexibility, fault isolation
**Cons**: Complexity, network latency, data consistency

### Event-Driven Architecture
Components communicate through events:
- **Event Producers**: Generate events
- **Event Consumers**: React to events
- **Event Channels**: Transport events

**Pros**: Loose coupling, scalability, real-time processing
**Cons**: Complex debugging, eventual consistency

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)
Isolates core business logic from external concerns:
- **Core**: Business logic
- **Ports**: Interfaces for external communication
- **Adapters**: Implementations of ports

**Pros**: Testability, flexibility, independence from frameworks
**Cons**: Initial complexity, over-engineering risk

## Design Principles

### SOLID Principles

**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
A class should have only one reason to change.

**Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass.

**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.

**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Avoid code duplication by abstracting common functionality.

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
Prefer simple solutions over complex ones.

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
Don't implement functionality until it's actually needed.

## Quality Attributes

### Performance
- **Throughput**: Requests processed per unit time
- **Latency**: Time to process a single request
- **Response Time**: Time from request to response

### Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more servers
- **Vertical Scaling**: Adding more power to existing servers
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing requests across servers

### Reliability
- **Availability**: System uptime percentage
- **Fault Tolerance**: Ability to continue operating despite failures
- **Recovery**: Time to restore service after failure

### Security
- **Authentication**: Verifying user identity
- **Authorization**: Controlling access to resources
- **Data Protection**: Encrypting sensitive information

### Maintainability
- **Modularity**: Well-defined, independent components
- **Readability**: Clear, understandable code
- **Testability**: Easy to write and run tests

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
Document important architectural decisions:
- **Context**: Situation requiring a decision
- **Decision**: The chosen solution
- **Status**: Proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes

## Technology Stack Considerations

### Frontend
- **Frameworks**: React, Angular, Vue.js
- **State Management**: Redux, MobX, Vuex
- **Build Tools**: Webpack, Vite, Parcel

### Backend
- **Languages**: Java, Python, Node.js, Go, C#
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot, Django, Express, Gin
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis

### Infrastructure
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
- **Containers**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Big Ball of Mud
Lack of clear architecture leading to tangled code.

### God Object
Single class that knows too much or does too much.

### Spaghetti Code
Code with complex and tangled control structure.

### Golden Hammer
Using the same solution for every problem.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with simple architecture and evolve
2. **Document Decisions**: Use ADRs to capture reasoning
3. **Consider Trade-offs**: Every decision has pros and cons
4. **Plan for Change**: Design for flexibility and evolution
5. **Measure Performance**: Use metrics to validate decisions
6. **Security by Design**: Consider security from the beginning
7. **Automate Testing**: Ensure architecture supports testing
8. **Monitor Production**: Observe system behavior in production

## Conclusion
Good software architecture balances multiple quality attributes while meeting business requirements. It requires understanding trade-offs, following proven principles, and continuously evolving based on feedback and changing needs.
