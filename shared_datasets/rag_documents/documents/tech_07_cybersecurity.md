# Cybersecurity Best Practices and Threat Landscape

## Introduction
Cybersecurity involves protecting digital systems, networks, and data from cyber threats. As organizations become increasingly digital, robust cybersecurity measures are essential.

## Common Threats

### Malware
- **Viruses**: Self-replicating programs that attach to other files
- **Trojans**: Disguised malicious software
- **Ransomware**: Encrypts data and demands payment
- **Spyware**: Secretly monitors user activity

### Social Engineering
- **Phishing**: Fraudulent emails to steal credentials
- **Spear Phishing**: Targeted phishing attacks
- **Pretexting**: Creating false scenarios to gain information
- **Baiting**: Offering something enticing to spread malware

### Network Attacks
- **DDoS**: Overwhelming systems with traffic
- **Man-in-the-Middle**: Intercepting communications
- **SQL Injection**: Exploiting database vulnerabilities
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injecting malicious scripts

## Security Framework

### CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality**: Protecting information from unauthorized access
- **Integrity**: Ensuring data accuracy and completeness
- **Availability**: Maintaining system accessibility

### Defense in Depth
Multiple layers of security controls:
1. Physical security
2. Network security
3. Endpoint security
4. Application security
5. Data security
6. Identity and access management

## Best Practices

### Access Control
- Principle of least privilege
- Multi-factor authentication
- Regular access reviews
- Strong password policies

### Network Security
- Firewalls and intrusion detection
- Network segmentation
- VPN for remote access

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular backups
- Data classification
- Secure disposal

### Incident Response
- Incident response plan
- Regular drills and testing
- Forensic capabilities
- Communication procedures

## Compliance and Regulations
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)
- PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)

## Emerging Threats
- AI-powered attacks
