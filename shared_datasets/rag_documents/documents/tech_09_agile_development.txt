Agile Software Development Methodologies

AGILE MANIFESTO

The Agile Manifesto, created in 2001, values:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

AGILE PRINCIPLES

1. Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
3. Deliver working software frequently
4. Business people and developers must work together daily
5. Build projects around motivated individuals
6. Face-to-face conversation is the most efficient communication
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Sustainable development pace
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence
10. Simplicity - maximizing the amount of work not done
11. Self-organizing teams
12. Regular reflection and adaptation

SCRUM FRAMEWORK

Roles:
- Product Owner: Defines product vision and priorities
- Scrum Master: Facilitates process and removes impediments
- Development Team: Cross-functional team that builds the product

Events:
- Sprint Planning: Plan work for the upcoming sprint
- Daily Scrum: 15-minute daily synchronization meeting
- Sprint Review: Demonstrate completed work to stakeholders
- Sprint Retrospective: Reflect on process and identify improvements

Artifacts:
- Product Backlog: Prioritized list of features and requirements
- Sprint Backlog: Work selected for the current sprint
- Increment: Potentially shippable product increment

KANBAN METHOD

Principles:
- Visualize workflow
- Limit work in progress (WIP)
- Manage flow
- Make policies explicit
- Implement feedback loops
- Improve collaboratively

Kanban Board:
- To Do: Work items waiting to be started
- In Progress: Work currently being done
- Done: Completed work items

EXTREME PROGRAMMING (XP)

Practices:
- Pair Programming: Two developers working together
- Test-Driven Development: Write tests before code
- Continuous Integration: Frequent code integration
- Refactoring: Improving code structure without changing functionality
- Simple Design: Keep design as simple as possible
- Collective Code Ownership: Everyone can modify any code
- On-site Customer: Customer representative available to team
- Small Releases: Frequent small releases to production

LEAN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

Principles:
- Eliminate waste
- Amplify learning
- Decide as late as possible
- Deliver as fast as possible
- Empower the team
- Build integrity in
- See the whole

SCALED AGILE FRAMEWORKS

SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework):
- Portfolio level: Strategic themes and epics
- Program level: Agile Release Trains (ARTs)
- Team level: Scrum/Kanban teams

LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum):
- Scaling Scrum to multiple teams
- Single Product Owner and Product Backlog
- Sprint Planning with all teams

AGILE ESTIMATION

Techniques:
- Planning Poker: Team-based estimation using cards
- T-shirt Sizing: Relative sizing (XS, S, M, L, XL)
- Story Points: Relative complexity estimation
- Ideal Days: Estimation in ideal working days

AGILE TESTING

Approaches:
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
- Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)
- Continuous Testing

Test Pyramid:
- Unit Tests: Fast, isolated tests
- Integration Tests: Component interaction tests
- End-to-End Tests: Full system tests

AGILE METRICS

Velocity: Amount of work completed per sprint
Burndown Charts: Work remaining over time
Cumulative Flow Diagram: Work flow visualization
Lead Time: Time from request to delivery
Cycle Time: Time from start to completion

COMMON CHALLENGES

- Resistance to change
- Lack of customer involvement
- Insufficient training
- Scaling difficulties
- Maintaining quality under pressure
- Distributed teams
- Legacy system constraints

BENEFITS OF AGILE

- Faster time to market
- Improved quality
- Better customer satisfaction
- Increased team morale
- Greater flexibility
- Reduced risk
- Better visibility and control
