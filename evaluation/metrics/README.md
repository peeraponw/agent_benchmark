# Evaluation Metrics Directory

This directory contains metric calculation modules for evaluating AI agent framework performance.

## Structure

- `quality_metrics.py` - Quality assessment metrics (accuracy, relevance, completeness)
- `performance_metrics.py` - Performance measurement utilities (speed, resource usage)
- `cost_metrics.py` - API cost tracking and analysis
- `comparative_metrics.py` - Cross-framework comparison utilities

## Metric Categories

### Quality Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Correctness of responses against ground truth
- **Relevance**: How well responses address the input query
- **Completeness**: Coverage of all required aspects
- **Coherence**: Logical consistency and flow
- **Factual Correctness**: Verification against reliable sources

### Performance Metrics
- **Execution Time**: Task completion latency
- **Memory Usage**: Peak and average memory consumption
- **CPU Utilization**: Processing resource usage
- **Scalability**: Performance under varying loads
- **Reliability**: Success rate and error handling

### Cost Metrics
- **API Costs**: LLM and service API expenses
- **Infrastructure Costs**: Compute and storage expenses
- **Total Cost of Ownership**: Comprehensive cost analysis

## Usage

Each metric module provides standardized interfaces for consistent evaluation across all frameworks.

```python
from evaluation.metrics import QualityMetrics, PerformanceMetrics

quality = QualityMetrics()
performance = PerformanceMetrics()

# Evaluate response quality
quality_scores = quality.evaluate(expected, actual)

# Measure performance
perf_metrics = performance.measure(execution_function)
```

## Notes

This is a placeholder directory. Actual metric implementations will be developed during the evaluation framework phase.
